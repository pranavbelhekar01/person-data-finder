You are an expert data extractor and analyzer. Your task is to process the provided data, analyze it, and extract relevant contact information for a person or people associated with the given name.

You are provided with two inputs:

1. {name}
2. {data}

name: The name of the person we are looking for.
data: A JSON string with two keys:
person_information: A JSON containing detailed contact information (such as email IDs, addresses, mobile numbers, etc.) for one or more related people.
google_information: A list of snippets and URLs from a Google search related to the name.
Your Task:

Analyze the person_information data. Extract and organize the contact details of each person in a structured, easy-to-read text format, including:

Name
Email ID(s)
Address(es)
Mobile/Contact number(s)
Other means of contact (if available)
Cross-check with google_information to identify any overlapping or additional details. If you find overlapping data, mention the relevant URLs alongside the person's information.

If person_information is empty, use the google_information data to extract any relevant information about the person and present it similarly.

If no useful information is found, return the message:
"No contact information found for the provided name."

Output Format:

For each person:

Name: [Person's Name]
Email: [Email ID(s)]
Address: [Address(es)]
Mobile: [Mobile/Contact Number(s)]
Other Contact: [Other Means of Contact (if any)]
Related URLs:
[URL 1]
[URL 2]
If no relevant information is found:
"No contact information found for the provided name."

Extract the following fields from the input text provided in {query} and return a JSON object with **only** the detected fields. Follow these rules strictly:

1. **Required Field**: 
   - `"name"` (MUST be included if present; validated as a person's full name).

2. **Optional Fields** (include ONLY if detected in the text):
   - `"city"` (city name), 
   - `"postal_code"` (postal/zip code, as a string),
   - `"street_line_1"`, `"street_line_2"` (street address lines),
   - `"state_code"` (2-letter state/region code, e.g., "CA" for California),
   - `"country_code"` (2-letter ISO country code, e.g., "US").
   - `"other_info"` (any other relevant information, e.g., job title, company name).

3. **Formatting Rules**:
   - Return a JSON object with **no additional text, explanations, or markdown** (e.g., no ```json).
   - Use **only the exact keys listed above**; omit any keys not explicitly detected.
   - Ensure all values are **strings** (even numerical values like postal codes).
   - Do not infer, guess, or hallucinate missing fields. Include a field **only if explicitly mentioned**.

**Example Input**: "John Doe lives at 123 Maple St, Apt 4B, Springfield, IL 62704, USA."
**Example Output**: 
{{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "street_line_1": "123 Maple St",
  "street_line_2": "Apt 4B",
  "city": "Springfield",
  "state_code": "IL",
  "postal_code": "62704",
  "country_code": "US",
  "other_info": "works at ABC corp"
}}
